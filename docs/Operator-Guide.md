# Foresignal Operator Guide

How to run and tune a Foresignal instance through its API. Later prompts add sections for their
features. Every write below needs the admin token: `Authorization: Bearer fsr_…`.

## Sources

A source is one upstream feed, such as `usgs-earthquakes`. Every source is installed **disabled**.
Enabling it is the only thing that makes Foresignal contact that upstream; reading or streaming data
never triggers a fetch.

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/sources` | Every source, with status, tier, license and today's budget use |
| `GET /v1/sources/{id}` | Descriptor, settings and health of one source |
| `PUT /v1/sources/{id}` | Partial settings change (admin) |
| `PUT` / `DELETE /v1/sources/{id}/credentials` | Store or remove upstream keys (admin; never returned) |
| `POST /v1/sources/{id}/fetch` | Fetch once now, ingesting normally (admin; uses budget) |
| `POST /v1/sources/{id}/probe` | Diagnostic fetch that never ingests (admin; uses budget) |
| `GET /v1/sources/health`, `GET /v1/sources/{id}/health` | Health, coverage and storage cost |
| `GET /v1/sources/{id}/usage` | Requests, bytes and ingest counters over time |
| `GET /v1/sources/{id}/fetches` | Per-fetch provenance log (admin) |

Enable a source, with a slower poll and a smaller budget:

```json
PUT /v1/sources/usgs-earthquakes
{"enabled": true, "interval": "5m", "budget": {"perMinute": 2, "perDay": 500}}
```

Omitted fields are left unchanged. A source that needs credentials returns `409 CREDENTIALS_REQUIRED`
until you store them with `PUT /v1/sources/{id}/credentials`.

### History tiers

Each source's descriptor fixes its `historyTier`:

- **STANDARD** (discrete records: earthquakes, alerts, filings). Retention is per source: your
  `retention` setting, else the descriptor's `defaultRetention`, else the global default. Set or
  clear it with `"retention": "365d"` or `"retention": null`.
- **TRACK** (moving things: aircraft, vessels). Every TRACK source shares one window,
  `retention.trackWindow` (3 days by default). A per-source `retention` is refused with
  `400 RETENTION_TIER_FIXED`; change `retention.trackWindow` instead.

`settings.effectiveRetention` shows the window in force for either tier.

### Ingest policies

The ingest policy decides which observations become stored versions. Everything else updates live
state only. The descriptor has a default (`descriptor.defaultIngestPolicy`). Your override is
`settings.ingestPolicy`, and `settings.effectiveIngestPolicy` is the one in force.

| Mode | Stores |
|---|---|
| `ALL` | Every change, plus a keyframe |
| `SAMPLED` | Significant changes, trigger edges and keyframes. Also a sample every `minInterval` when the position deviates by `minDeviationMeters` or a threshold moves (`thresholds: true`) |
| `LATEST` | Significant changes, trigger edges and keyframes only |

Override a policy, for example to sample aircraft less often:

```json
PUT /v1/sources/adsb-area
{"ingestPolicy": {"mode": "SAMPLED", "minInterval": "60s", "keyframe": "240s",
                  "minDeviationMeters": 1000, "thresholds": true, "edgeMinInterval": "30s"}}
```

Send `"ingestPolicy": null` to go back to the descriptor default. The rules (Core-Data-Model §5.1):

- `2s ≤ minInterval ≤ keyframe`, and `edgeMinInterval ≤ minInterval` (default `minInterval / 2`).
- With a record TTL: `keyframe ≤ ttl − pollInterval − 30s`.
- `"keyframe": "none"` is allowed only when the source has no TTL.
- `SAMPLED` and `LATEST` need a source that declares `significantFields`.

A policy that breaks a rule returns `400 INGEST_POLICY_INVALID`. Every violation is listed in
`errors[]` with its field, for example `ingestPolicy.keyframe`.

### The fetch log

`GET /v1/sources/{id}/fetches` lists one row per fetch, stream flush or push batch, newest first.
Each row has its trigger and status, HTTP status, redacted URL, ETag, body hash, license, per-reason
counts and the seq range it wrote. Request and response bodies are never kept.

- Page with `limit` (up to 1000) and pass each page's `nextAfter` as `after`.
- Filter with `status` (`OK`, `NOT_MODIFIED`, `FAILED`, `REFUSED`, `DISCARDED`) and `trigger`
  (`SCHEDULED`, `MANUAL`, `STREAM`, `PUSH`).
- A row's `id` is the `batchId` on the versions it wrote.

### Reading `storage` and `budgetHoursRemaining`

Source health includes `storage`, which shows what the source costs:

- `observationsPerMinute`, `versionsPerMinute`: what arrives and what is stored, over the last hour.
- `persistRatio`: versions ÷ observations. A low ratio on a busy feed means the policy is doing its
  job. If it is near 1 on a position feed, consider `SAMPLED`.
- `triggerEdgeShare`: share of versions forced by trigger edges. Above 0.2, a trigger rule is
  probably flapping at a threshold; raise `edgeMinInterval` or adjust the rule.
- `bytesPerDay` (7-day average) and `projectedBytes` (`bytesPerDay` × retention window): the disk
  this source will hold at steady state.
- `lateLastHour`, `clampedLastHour`: observations that arrived out of order, and ones with
  timestamps in the future.

`budgetHoursRemaining` is how many hours today's request budget lasts at the last hour's rate. It is
`null` when nothing was requested in the last hour. If it is low early in the UTC day, lengthen the
`interval` or raise `budget.perDay`.
